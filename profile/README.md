# About us

We are the Team "Transparent Social Analytics" in the [CSS
department](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/departments/computational-social-science)
at [GESIS](https://gesis.org). Our mission is to make collection, preprocessing
and analysis methods for digital behavioral data reusable and transparent, and
to develop new computational tools for social science research. 

This account contains open source material (predominantly R packages) created
