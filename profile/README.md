# About us

We are the Team "Transparent Social Analytics" in the [CSS
department](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/departments/computational-social-science)
at [GESIS](https://gesis.org). Our mission is to make collection, preprocessing
and analysis methods for digital behavioral data reusable and transparent, and
to develop new computational tools for social science research.
